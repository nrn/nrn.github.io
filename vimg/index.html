  <h1>vimg</h1>

  <p>
  vimg is a simple bash function I wrote a couple of years ago.
  <pre class="literal">
    function vimg() {
     files=`git grep -Ie $1 --name-only`
     vim $files +/$1
    }
  </pre>
  <p>
  Just a couple of lines, but it is has has a huge impact on my work flow.
  The usage is simple, inside of any git repository you type
  <code class="literal">
    vimg thingYouWantToFind
  </code>
  This gets a list of file names from grep that contain that pattern, and
  opens them all in vim, also highlighting the search term. Combining both
  of those moves into one lets you quickly move through a code base to explore
  and refactor.
  <p>
  vimg is short for "vim grep". The idea being that it is
  similar to vimdiff, a wrapper around vim that opens up
  a few files with options set for a specialized situation.
  <p>
  I think the key to its success is that it allows me to not
  just interact with one thing over many files quickly; it
  allows me to do so without knowing anything about where
  the thing is, or how many things touch it beforehand.
  <p>
  Give it a try, and let
