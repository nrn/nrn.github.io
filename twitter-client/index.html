  <h1>Twitter client</h1>
  <p>
    I have never been very happy with the twitter clients I have tried, they
    always seem to jump around and loose my place, especially when I click a
    link. All the inline images and autoplay videos trying to grasp for my
    attention as I scroll by drive me nuts.
  <p>
    I want to read twitter on my phone, and not give an app a bunch of
    bullshit permissions it doesn't need. Which usually means a webapp. In
    twitter's case I also don't want that webapp to share cookie storage with
    my normal browsing.
  <p>
    Coincidently I've been thinking a lot about browser compatibility, and
    client vrs. server rendering. The one thing that's still giving me pause
    about fully client rendered single page apps is Opera Mini. It has a lot of
    users, disproportionately the newly connected. It's common to ignore Opera
    Mini during development, so I wanted to try it out for myself, and see how
    some sites did.
  <p>
    Being unhappy with my Twitter client, it was the first thing to try.
    And I was happily surprised. The Twitter webapp on Opera
    Mini is fast and simple. No janky infinite scroll, just nice long
    paginated pages. And you have to click through to open media, making
    it a lot faster to read.
  <p>
    So, I have a new favorite Twitter client: Opera Mini.
