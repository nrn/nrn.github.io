    One of the interesting things about starting this project is how much
    easier it is to get to the writing part. Nothing to bikeshed if you
    just start.

    Another is how many things I've forgotten that I previously would have
    considered critical. The modern mess of automation and frameworks does
    remove the programmer from a lot of details.

    Literally as soon as I finished the last two paragraphs I went off
    to bikeshed things. I stand by there being less distractions, none
    was more than a little grandiose though.
