  <h1>First post</h1>
  <p>
    One of the interesting things about starting this project is how much
    easier it is to get to the writing part. Nothing to bikeshed if you
    just start.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another is how many things I've forgotten that I previously would have
    considered critical. The modern mess of automation and frameworks does
    remove the programmer from a lot of details.
  </p>
  <p>
    Literally as soon as I finished the last two paragraphs I went off
    to bikeshed things. I stand by there being less distractions, none
    was more than a little grandiose though.
