  <h1>Best Practices</h1>

  <p>This post isn't about any particular "Best Practices", but rather about
  the idea of "Best Practices" as a whole. It's natural to want a list of dos
  and do nots, especially if you're new, or unsure of yourself in an area. But
  life is rarely that simple. Nearly every practice has a context where it can
  be good or bad, usually even best or worst. Calling one thing out as a "Best
  Practice" is championing that one way above all others, in all situations.
  Sometimes this is done in an attempt to help by simplifying a complex topic,
  sometimes it's parroting advice from another source who may have been in a
  different situation, sometimes it's just plain ignorance of other things that
  could be done, and sometimes it's used maliciously in an attempt to undermine
  other people's suggestions.

  <p>A few things can be safely generalized, in that the context is so broad
  that exceptions may not be worth mentioning. Don't run next to the pool,
  unless you are saving someone from drowning. Don't use the "with" keyword in
  JavaScript, unless you are saving someone from drowning. These are things
  that I would be comfortable citing as "Best Practices" without their
  attending caveats. 

  <p>Other things that seem safe really do have a lot of subtlety around them.
  One common Best Practice is "gzip your http responses"... well usually, but
  for small payloads gzip may not save any space. And it always takes some CPU
  (energy and time). So even though gzipping your responses is really good
  advice, you still need to think about how it applies to what you're doing.
  For example, if you were serving a bunch of unique &lt; 1kb latency sensitive
  responses on the LAN from a raspberry pi 0 attached to a battery, well then
  gzip is worse than useless, it's counter productive in every way.

  <p>So, what's the alternative to espousing everything as a "Best Practice"?
  Talk about practices <strong>with</strong> the goal they achieve or problem
  they solve and the context in which they are proven to work in practice. Now,
  some more astute readers will be ready to butt in here and point out that
  that is essentially the definition of a Software Pattern. I noticed that too!
  We have a method of discussing solutions in non-absolute terms, we just
  don't.  There are probably a lot of reasons for this, you can't fit a well
  reasoned pattern into 140 or even 250 characters to tweet it, looking at all
  sides of the issue doesn't help you promote the use of your favorite tech
  over others, and quite honestly it's a lot of work and we're lazy creatures.

  <p>Having seen this misused by people furthering their own agenda recently,
  I'm going to make a renewed effort to be less binary in my discussions of
  technologies and practices, and read more in depth about patterns to help
  myself do a better job.
  
  <p>p.s. Anti-patterns should also be discussed with goals, context in which
  they don't work, and why they might appear appealing to try. In modern usage
  the term has become an absolute like "Best Practices" used to stomp all over
  someone who is trying something, without leaving room for a nuanced
  discussion.
