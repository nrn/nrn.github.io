  <h1>JS Frameworks April 2016</h1>

  <p>
  Some of these are opinions that have been brewing for a year or two, some
  of them are brand new. Due to the rate of change in JavaScript and the
  surrounding ecosystem they are hopefully timely, and likely have a very
  short shelf life. As of writing, today April 3rd 2016, this is what I think
  about choosing a JavaScript framework.

  <p>
  There is no universal best choice.

  <p>
  Optimize for change. If you look at the landscape of accelerating
  progress in the JS ecosystem, revolutionary frameworks, new APIs, language
  syntax, build systems, module loaders, specs, transpilers, preprocessors, and
  etc. And think "on, they've probably got it right now, I'll just learn this
  one thing and use it forever." You are in for a world of hurt. It just doesn't
  work that way. If you and your code base are in this for the long haul, get
  right with the idea you will have to evolve with the ecosystem, and abandon
  choices you make today, frequently.

  <p>
  Componentization seems to have the most value.

  <p>
  Whatever you choose you may end up owning. There is never a guaranty that
  a framework will continue to be maintained, that the bugs you find will
  be of interest to the maintainers, or that they won't take it in a direction
  incompatible with your use case. This isn't a reason not to use frameworks,
  just a good reason not to use one you aren't willing to work on.

  <p>
  Don't rely on TodoMVC to do your thinking for you. TodoMVC has been a great
  tool for our community for people new to a framework to be able to see how it
  works, and grasp some of the concepts it introduces. It's been misused as a
  tool for evaluating and comparing frameworks against each other. If you're
  going to compare frameworks head to head, you need to do so in your problem
  domain. Comparing how they work for writing a todo list is pretty much only
  good for seeing how they do as a todo list app framework. Even in the rare
  case you are doing a todo list, you need to write the examples yourself.
  Looking at example usages of the frameworks you are considering doesn't tell
  you how it feels to write the example, or how your team will take to
  it. Once the choice has been made, point people to the TodoMVC app of your
  framework of choice, to compare and contrast with your internal
  example/starting app.

  <p>
  Angular and Ember are both frameworks looking for a problem. They arise from
  a lot of experience and frustration with front end development, but no
  specific use case. React was born from the best of facebook's front
  end stack being abstracted for reuse in the instagram webapp. Being something
  that is worked on constantly in the context of multiple flagship applications
  has a hugely positive effect on React, where as not having that tight
  feedback loop with serious real projects shows when you build with Angular
  or Ember.

  <p>
  Also, just don't choose Angular 1.x. It's a dead end. As soon as you try to do
  anything suitably complex you spend all of your time working around their
  provided abstractions.

  <p>
  Mixed rendering applications are very painful.

  <p>
  "isomorphic" applications are a cool idea, but probably not worth the
  limitations.
