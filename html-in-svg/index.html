  <h1>HTML in SVG</h1>
  <h2>OMG YOU CAN PUT HTML IN SVG.</h2>
  <p>
  It is hard to overstate how excited I was when I figured
  this out. I couldn't believe it. Anyone who has tried
  to do text formatting and flow in SVG knows what a
  nightmare it is. Even something as simple as two lines
  of text with a background becomes a mind boggling chore.
  <p>
  I've worked with a couple of other solutions in the past;
  overlaying absolutely positioned html on top of the SVG, and
  building up a bunch of abstractions to help format the text
  in SVG itself. The absolute positioning is super tedious,
  making it track and position on a window relative grid that
  lines up to the coordinates inside a translated scaled svg grid ends
  up with a very brittle situation. Building up a bunch
  of abstractions and pieces to put it together just means
  a ton of layers to debug when things don't look right.

  Enter our hero, &ltforeignObject&gt. It is an SVG tag that
  allows non-SVG XML objects to be added inside of an SVG,
  like it was inside the SVG at that point!
  Check it out on
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/foreignObject">mdn</a>
  and
  <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=svg-html">caniuse</a>.
  Sure, support isn't perfect,
  but it is wide spread. For simple use cases it
  works in all modern browsers, and fall backs are available.
